                        <p className="about-para">In my retail visual merchandising career, I would approach problems in store displays and layouts by observing customer interactions with the displays, making changes based on what I saw. Afterwards, I loved checking the stats and listening to staff feedback to make small improvements until we got it right. <br/>
                            When I learned UX Design was in 2017, I was inspired to go and study ASAP so I could learn more about design and use design thinking approaches to solve interesting challenges.
