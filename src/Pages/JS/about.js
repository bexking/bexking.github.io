                    <p>Ko Rebecca King toku ingoa.</p>
                    <p>I'm a UX/UI designer living in Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington). </p> 
                    <p>I have recently completed a Bachelor of Design Innovation in Interaction Design at Te Herenga Waka/Victoria University of Wellington. Before studying, I worked in the retail industry as a Visual Merchandising Manager for Lush Australia & NZ. In this role I would travel around our shops, observe customer flows, interview staff and create product displays and layout changes to create better experiences for staff and customers.<br>
                    </br>
                        Once I learned about UX, I wanted to take that logic and experience and apply it to digital products.</p>
                    <p>I love creating products and systems that are grounded in research and have logical flows.</p>
                    <p>I love problems that are a bit messy and have a lot of complexity to them.</p>
                    <p>Though I love to be practical, I also like to add joy and elements of surprise.</p>
                    <p>I love to break open a brief, set assumptions aside and find the root of a problem, before creatively solving it.</p>
