                        Within service design work with Interislander's CX team, I identified the potential for the booking system to better serve customers and business goals and was given the opportunity to redesign the system with a colleague.

                    <p>
                        The redesign aimed to improve usability and time taken to book. I reviewed the exisiting site and used insights from the service design work and Digital Marketing to inform decisions. I developed a new information architecture to reduce complexity by only showing customers what was relevant and created mid-fidelity digital prototypes with a colleague to bring the design to life. The design was iterated on weekly, incorporating emerging requirements from the service design stream.

                        At project completion, Interislanderâ€™s usual digital agency received the prototypes for final refinement and development. During internal testing booking time was reportedly halved. The final version went live in November, 2024.
