roleplaying game released by Nintendo for Nintendo Switch in 2020.<br/>\n                        The player is a villager on a small deserted island. The island has space for up to 10 anthropomorphic animals who can move in as villagers, with several species of animals featured, and eight different personality types.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Many players have favourite villagers that they seek to find for their town (known by the fandom as “Dreamies”). One main way to find a new villager is to take a Mystery Island Tour, where a seemingly random villager will be present if you have space available in your game. Visiting a mystery island requires an in-game airplane ticket, which can take a lot of effort to obtain.\n                        I wanted to create a tool that would let people budget for tickets better, and see how different factors increased their odds.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        The result of my project is Dreamy Finder which can be found online <a href=\"http://bexking.github.io/acnh-dreamy-finder\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, or take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/bexking/acnh-dreamy-finder\" target=\"_blank\">my Github</a>.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"written-content\">\n                    <h2>Research & Observations</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        When Animal Crossing: New Horizons released I noticed many people (including friends, streamers, people posting online) were visiting mystery islands trying to find their favourite villagers. There are around 400 villagers in the game, but people were saving up tickets and becoming shocked when the amount of tickets required crept up sometimes into the thousands before finding the villager they were after.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Dataminers found out how mystery island character was generated, and discovered villager selection wasn't a simple 1/400 villagers.\n                        They found out the game first selects for one of the 35 animal species, and then a random character within each species.\n                        You can see the same character selected an unlimited number of times in a play session, and the same character can also be selected multiple times in a row.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>\n                        This can lead to some interesting strategies that are less obvious. For example, if you are searching for an octopus, there are only 3 octopi in the game.\n                        If you took an octopus you didn’t particularly want, the next time the game selected for the species octopus, you now have a 50% chance that the octopus is the one you want.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>\n                        I observed streamers on Twitch, and players in various Discords and Reddit forums saving up tickets to find their favourite villagers, with many saving their tickets into the hundreds, and being disappointed when the final totals were above 600-1000 tickets.\n                        I recorded a rough idea of their process and what they wanted to know/find out in order to determine what a player might want to know, and what the ideal user flow would be.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"modal-popout\">\n                        <Popup\n                            trigger={<img id=\"df-journey\" src={DfJourney2} alt=\"User Journey - annotated\" />}\n                            position='top center'>\n                            { close => (<>\n                                <img style={{height: \"1200px\", \"width\": \"927px\"}} src={DfJourney1} alt=\"User Journey - annotated\" />\n                                <button className=\"close\" onClick={close}>\n                                    &times;\n                                </button>\n                            </>)\n                        }\n                        </Popup>\n                    </div>\n                </div> */}\n\n                <div className=\"written-content\">\n                    <h2>Design Goals</h2>\n                    <div id=\"df-site-goals\">\n                        <div id=\"site-goals-text\">\n                            <h4 id=\"df-list-h4\">The site needs to:</h4>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    Be easy for players to use and understand\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    Make it easy for users to find a specific villager from the large list\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    Work on a wide range of devices\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    Provide players with data in a straightforward, easy to understand way\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    Allow players to easily adjust their inputs to see how different changes affect their odds\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n{\n                <div className=\"written-content\">\n                    <h2>Ideation & Prototyping</h2>\n                    <p>Ideation began with sketching to work out the general structure and logic of the page, before moving into Figma to start digital prototyping.</p>\n                    <div className=\"df-ideation-container\">\n                        <img className=\"df-ideation\" src={DfSketch1} alt=\"User Journey - annotated\" />\n                        <img className=\"df-ideation\" src={DfSketch2} alt=\"User Journey - annotated\" />\n                        <img className=\"df-ideation\" src={DfSketch3} alt=\"User Journey - annotated\" />\n                        <img className=\"df-ideation\" src={DfSketch4} alt=\"User Journey - annotated\" />\n                        <img className=\"df-ideation\" src={DfSketch5} alt=\"User Journey - annotated\" />\n                        <img className=\"df-ideation\" src={DfSketch6} alt=\"User Journey - annotated\" />\n                    </div>\n                    <p>\n                        Once I had a rough idea of the structure of the site, I iterated in Figma to create a more accurate and better quality prototype.\n                        Here I was able to wireframe the prototype and check that the flow was intuitive. I also began experimenting with the visual design, basing the fonts and colour palette off the in-game map.\n                    </p>\n                    <div className=\"digi-prototyping-container\">\n                        {/* <img id=\"acnh-map\" src={AcnhMap} alt=\"Example of ACNH in-game map\" />\n                        <div className=\"df-digital-prototyping\">\n                            <img className=\"df-digi-ideation\" src={DfIt1v1} alt=\"Rough first digital iteration page 1\" />\n                            <img className=\"df-digi-ideation\" src={DfIt1v2} alt=\"Rough first digital iteration page 2\" />\n                        </div>\n                        <p>\n                            I continued to iterate within Figma, working on improving flow, creating clear wireframes, and refining the visual style.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            The design was resolved into the below digital prototype. My main priority was to make it simple for users to find the villager they're looking for from the large list, so I planned to keep track of the state of the search box, so that the applicable results update with every keystroke.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            I also found an API that I could use to access the villager pictures, as well as important data I would need such as the villagers' species types and personality types for the results page.\n                        </p> */}\n                        <div className=\"df-video-section\">\n                            <video className=\"vid\" controls muted playsInline >\n                                <source src={DfPrototype} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n                            </video>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div> }\n\n                {/* <div className=\"written-content\">\n                    <h2>Building & Publishing the site</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        The site was built in React. This was the first site I'd ever built in React so it was a big learning curve. To make the site more interactive and a more natural user experience, I took advantage of state to keep the search box updating. It was great to be able to create components and reuse them throughout the site so I didn't have to repeat content. This was also the first time using an API. It was great to be able to get all the information and images I needed about each villager from the API and saved a lot of time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        See the project on my  <a href=\"http://bexking.github.io/acnh-dreamy-finder\" target=\"_blank\">github</a>.\n                    </p>\n                </div> */}\n            </div>\n            <SeeMore project1={\"ib\"} project2={\"hints\"} />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport '../CSS/projectPage.css';\nimport Hero from '../../Assets/dome.jpg';\n// import Home from './home.js';\nimport Nav from '../../Components/JS/nav2.js';\n\n\nexport default function Displacement() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"page\">\n            {/* <Home /> */}\n            <Nav />\n            \n            <div className=\"content\">\n                <h1 className=\"projecth1\">Displacement</h1>\n                <p>A photography project to draw attention the threat of sea level rise from man-made climate change.</p>\n                \n                <div className=\"heroImage\">\n                    <div className=\"dis-hero-image\" id=\"displace1\"></div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"heroImage\">\n                    <div className=\"dis-hero-image\" id=\"displace2\"></div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"heroImage\">\n                    <div className=\"dis-hero-image\" id=\"displace3\"></div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"heroImage\">\n                    <div className=\"dis-hero-image\" id=\"displace4\"></div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"heroImage\">\n                    <div className=\"dis-hero-image\" id=\"displace5\"></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"disGrid\">\n                <div className=\"hero-image\" id=\"displace1\"></div>\n                <div className=\"hero-image\" id=\"displace2\"></div>\n                <div className=\"hero-image\" id=\"displace3\"></div>\n                <div className=\"hero-image\" id=\"displace4\"></div>\n                <div className=\"hero-image\" id=\"displace5\"></div>\n            </div>\n\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport '../CSS/projectPage.css';\nimport Hero from '../../Assets/dome.jpg';\n// import Home from './home.js';\nimport Nav from '../../Components/JS/nav2.js';\n\n\nexport default function Dome() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"page\">\n            {/* <Home /> */}\n\n            <Nav />\n \n            <div className=\"content\">\n                <h1 className=\"projectTitle\">The Dome</h1>\n                <p>Rethinking the takeaway container based on psychology findings to aid portion control</p>\n                <div className=\"heroImage\">\n                    <div className=\"hero-image\" id=\"hero\"></div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"features\">\n                    <h3>Design Features</h3>\n                    <p>The takeaway container features two nested bowls to hold the main dish and the sides.

Inspired by psychology research, Incognito Breathing generates subtle breath-pacing visualisations based on your own digital workspace. As the visualisations are based on the user's own workspace, the website can easily be used in open plan offices without drawing unwanted attention from co-workers.\n                        </p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            Incognito Breathing was inspired by the psychology findings of Harris, Katkin, Lick & Habberfield in 1976. They found that paced respiration is easy to learn and very effective in promoting relaxation and reduced stress responses. <br/>\n                            Incognito Breathing is designed to help office workers manage mental health while at work, particularly in open plan offices where it can be more difficult to take a break. Incognito Breathing takes your workspace and applies a paced respiration timer to it, so users can do breathing exercises at right time/right place, without feeling insecure that someone will notice.\n                        </p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            Manfred Garhammer wrote in 2002 that half of German office workers felt time pressured - up from a quarter in 1990. Open-plan offices in particular can cause fatigue and stress, even at normal volume levels as found by Witterseh, Wyon, & Clausen in 2002. <br/>\n                            Paced respiration (deep, slow breathing from the diaphragm) helps manage stress and anxiety. Slowing, deep breathing lowers heart rates and prevents a state of hyperventilation from habitual over-breathing. Using paced respiration to manage anxiety is especially effective if it is practiced where the stress occurs, rather than removing yourself from a situation and then completing breath exercises. <br/>\n                            Staff experiencing stress and anxiety in open plan offices often feel too anxious to take a break, because they may worry people will notice them not working. This can make it difficult to manage stress using this technique.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div className=\"ib-hero-container\">\n                        <div className=\"ib-hero-imgs\">\n                            <img className=\"ib-hero-img\" id=\"ib-homepage-hero\" src={Homepage} alt=\"incognito breathing hompage shown on laptop\" />\n                            <img className=\"ib-hero-img\" src={ibofficemockup_1} alt=\"Office scene with incognito breathing visualisation shown on computer\" />\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div className=\"written-content\">\n                        <h2 className=\"ib-project-subheadings\">Discovery & Ideation</h2>\n                        <p>I researched paced respiration and how it is best used, and brainstormed different contexts in which people either feel stressed/anxious, and contexts where I thought paced respiration techniques would have the most benefit. <br/>\n                            Through secondary research techniques I learned about the physiological response of stress and anxiety and how shallow breathing can cause a state of constant hyperventilation, which worsens the problem. Without managing the breath, it can be difficult to manage other symptoms of stress and anxiety. <br/> \n                            Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) commonly uses paced respiration techniques to correct this overbreathing.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            From my research I considered places and situations where paced respiration could have the most use and realised there was a lot of opportunity to incorporate this practice into an office workday. <br/>\n                            Workplaces are becoming more stressful, and open plan offices in particular contribute to steady increases of stress, fatigue, anxiety and burnout. Paced respiration is easily learned, quickly effective, and only takes a couple of minutes, meaning it could easily become a part of someone’s workday routine to great effect\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div id=\"hmw\">\n                        <h3>How might we create a product that helps people relax and manage workplace stress in an office environment, by adding paced breathing techniques into daily routines?</h3>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div className=\"written-content\">\n                        <p>Three diverse concepts were pitched.
